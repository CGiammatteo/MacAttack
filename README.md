Basic macro program written in C#. MacAttack has the following functionality:

- Auto saving macros into loaded macro slots (includes the keybind)
- Easy to use macro builder


Macro builder button usage:
- Set builder: sets the current testing macro values to the ones specified in the text boxes above the button
- Save config: saves the created macro to the "macros" folder located where the .exe is located
- Edit config: load an already created macro into the builder to edit your settings
